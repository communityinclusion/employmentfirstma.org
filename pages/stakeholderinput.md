    <P>The Massachusetts Department of Developmental Service (DDS) in collaboration with the Institute for Community Inclusion at the University of Massachusetts Boston conducted forums and surveys to solicit information from community-based day support and employment providers, family members, and people served by DDS. The purpose of these activities was to learn about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for future approaches to day and employment services.</P>

    <p>We distributed a survey to family members to learn about their experiences and to get their input about future approaches to day and employment services. We shared this survey through providers, social media, and through partners, such as The Arc of Massachusetts and the Association of Developmental Disabilities Providers. In addition, we held two small group meetings and several individual interviews with family members to get input from a more diverse group of families. This report summarizes the input we received from family members.
    The family survey, interviews, and focus groups were conducted from March-May 2021. </p>
