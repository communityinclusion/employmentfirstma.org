One of the 4 focus areas of MPTE is development of cross-systems collaboration through cross-agency, cross-program, and cross-disciplinary collaborative efforts using a tiered approach at the state, local, and individual level. 

To accomplish this, MPTE is working to ensure that all agencies and stakeholders involved in transition to employment have a consistent approach, and that mechanisms are in place for strong collaboration between schools, disability and workforce agencies, service providers, and youth with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families, resulting in successful employment as an adult.
