title: Technical Assistance
---
On November 1, 2014, the Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services (DDS), in conjunction with the Association of Developmental Disabilities Providers and The ARC of Massachusetts, released the [Blueprint for Success: Employing Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities in Massachusetts](http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dmr/blueprint-for-success.pdf). The blueprint outlines a plan to implement [Employment First](http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/laws-regs/dds/policies/s-employment-first-policy-2010-2.html) in Massachusetts.
To assist providers with the transformation from center based work to work in the community, the ICI, with funding from DDS, has established the Employment First Technical Assistance Center. Through this center, the ICI provides training, technical assistance, and access to a wide range of tools and resources that support the blueprint.  


Over the past year, more than 18 agencies that recently offered center-based employment supports have received 
technical assistance to develop expanded capacity to provide integrated employment supports, as well as community-based day services. Technical assistance is provided by ICI staff as well as a cadre of qualified consultants.


A limited amount of technical assistance may be available for additional providers. Interested agencies should contact David Hoff at [david.hoff@umb.edu](mailto:david.hoff@umb.edu) or 617-287-4308 to discuss their needs and the application process.
