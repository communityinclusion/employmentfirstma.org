<h3><a href="http://connectpro97884399.adobeconnect.com/pxvdv4i6n2ts/">Financial Wellbeing: Reframing the Benefits
        Conversation</a></h3>
<p>When looking for a new job, most of us “do the math.”  We consider what we need (food, housing, healthcare) and what
    we want (a gym membership, a car, a vacation). Then we evaluate whether a particular job will help us achieve our
    goals.  So why do our conversations about employment for people with disabilities start with protecting Social
    Security benefits? </p>

<p>Benefits can be a lifeline, but continuous reliance on them can limit people to a life in poverty. In this webinar to
    learned more about how you can reframe the conversion and help people you support and their families to consider
    their options in a new way. </p>

        The 30-Day Placement Plan: Putting The Career Plan in Action</a> </h3>
<p>Finding and landing the right job is a long and complex endeavor. Many job seekers have found that breaking the job
    search down into a series of small, workable tasks makes this challenging process much more manageable. It also
    gives the job seeker a sense of control over the direction of the job search, and a sense of accomplishment when
    each task is completed. </p>

<p>One way to keep tasks in order and prioritized is to create a 30-day placement plan. In this webinar, we gave you all
    the information you need to craft and use such a plan.</p>

    searches are timely and stay on track. We also shared resources, information, and tips, and will give participants a
    chance to share their challenges and success stories.</p>

    increase employment and community inclusion; changing the transportation mindset among individuals, families, and

        Social Inclusion</a></h3>
<p>Effective job coaching strives to maximize employee independence and to promote stability at work. Job performance is
    only part of what leads to employment success. Equally essential is that the new employee fits in and is included in

<h3>The Truth Comes From Us: What Employment Supports Do Self-Advocates Want and Need?</h3>
<p>Employment professionals play a powerful role in supporting individuals with intellectual and developmental

    in Vermont. Max and Stirling talk about a paper by the national organization Self-Advocates Becoming Empowered
    (SABE). The SABE publication is based on interviews with self-advocates from across the U.S. People with IDD shared
    their personal experiences receiving support to work, and several themes were identified.</p>

<h3>Making the Best Impression: Using Visual Resumes for Success </h3>

<p>As employment professionals, we seek job development approaches that will present our job seekers in the most
    positive light to prospective business contacts. For many candidates, using alternatives to the traditional resume
    can be just the technique you are looking for to make a difference and help them shine! Visual and video resumes are
    innovative tools that can effectively portray job seekers’ versatility, individuality, and capabilities to employers
    in a creative and powerful way. This webinar featured Dennis Cleary from the Nisonger Center at Ohio State
    University; and Kristen Piccolo, from the Pathways to Careers Program, at WORK, Inc. Dorchester, MA. Both use visual
    resumes extensively in their work. They will shared examples, explained how to develop and produce visual resumes,
    as well as presented how these tools can be used directly with employers. </p>

<h3>Words of Wisdom: Achieving Successful Jobs for Individual’s with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)</h3>
<p>More and more individuals with autism have been able to go to work in the community. Quality employment practices
    have been studied, shared, and documented. Experience has shown that workers with autism can offer distinct
    strengths and skills of value in the workplace. Although this progress is encouraging, professionals in the field
    still experience significant day-to-day challenges creating strong matches for those with unique and complex needs.
</p>

<p>This webinar is presented by Katina Demetriou, director of Autism Delaware’s POW&R (Productive Opportunities for Work
    and Recreation) program. Katina has extensive experience placing and supporting individuals, across the spectrum, in
    their own integrated, competitive community jobs. She understands the reality of working with job seekers and
    workers with intensive communication and behavioral support needs. She is in a great position to share her success
    strategies and solutions with you all!</p>

<p>This webinar will begin by presenting a brief overview of important considerations to guide placement planning,
    followed by candid and honest discussion of job development and support strategies to address barriers. We aim to
    provide a practical, hands-on session to offer you fresh and effective employment services strategies for people
    with ASD.</p>

<h3>Volunteering, Internships, and Unpaid Work Experiences: Legal and Practical Guidelines</h3>

<p>With the expansion of employment in the community and community based non-work, volunteering, internships, and
    similar activities for people with disabilities are becoming increasingly a part of their daily routines. It is
    critically important that service systems and service providers understand under what circumstances individuals can
    volunteer, participate in internships, and engage in job exploration, assessment, and training without pay.</p>

<p>This webinar will look at both legal and practical guidelines for these types of experiences, with a focus on
    complying with the legal requirements that apply under these circumstances, as well as how such experiences fit
    within overall efforts to expand employment and community opportunities. Attendees will strengthen their knowledge
    regarding options for these activities, as well as ensuring that they are in full compliance with the labor laws and
    regulations that govern them.</p>

<h3>Building Friendships At Work</h3>
<p>It is abundantly clear that friendships are important in everyone's lives. People with friends are happier than those
    who don't have friends. They have greater self-esteem. They are healthier and they are safer. These benefits can be
    especially critical for people with disabilities in a world that still often isolates them.</p>

<p>Widening the Circle is a partnership between the Arc of MA and the MA Department of Developmental Services. This
    project has been exploring the opportunities—formal and informal—that support the development of friendships between
    people with and without disabilities. These opportunities for friendships are everywhere, where people live, learn,
    play and WORK.</p>

<p>Please join Rick Hawes (Director of Employment Services at the Berkshire County Arc) and Jim Ross (Co-coordinator of
    Widening the Circle) as they explore WHY supporting friendships in the workplace is important. This webinar will
    also discuss WHAT employment staff can do to support friendships. Whether you facilitate planning, are a job
    developer, or are a job coach, there is a role for you!</p>
