<p>
  The Charting the LifeCourse framework is based on the core belief that all
  people and their families have the right to live, love, learn, work, play and
  pursue their life aspirations in their community. The Charting the Life Course
  framework and tools can be used by individuals, families, and professionals to
  envision and chart a course toward a good life. Charting the Life Course is
  being adopted throughout Massachusetts in various ways.
