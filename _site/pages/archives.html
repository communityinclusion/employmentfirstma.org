<h3><a href="http://connectpro97884399.adobeconnect.com/pxvdv4i6n2ts/">Financial Wellbeing: Reframing the Benefits Conversation</a> (webinar, April 2018)</h3>
<p>When looking for a new job, most of us “do the math.”  We consider what we need (food, housing, healthcare) and what we want (a gym membership, a car, a vacation). Then we evaluate whether a particular job will help us achieve our goals.  So why do our conversations about employment for people with disabilities start with protecting Social Security benefits? </p>

<p>Benefits can be a lifeline, but continuous reliance on them can limit people to a life in poverty. In this webinar to learned more about how you can reframe the conversion and help people you support and their families to consider their options in a new way.  </p>

<h3>Volunteering, Internships, and Unpaid Work Experiences: Legal and Practical Guidelines (February 25, 2016)</h3>

<p>With the expansion of employment in the community and community based non-work, volunteering, internships, and similar activities for people with disabilities are becoming increasingly a part of their daily routines. It is critically important that service systems and service providers understand under what circumstances individuals can volunteer, participate in internships, and engage in job exploration, assessment, and training without pay.</p>

<p>This webinar will look at both legal and practical guidelines for these types of experiences, with a focus on complying with the legal requirements that apply under these circumstances, as well as how such experiences fit within overall efforts to expand employment and community opportunities. Attendees will strengthen their knowledge regarding options for these activities, as well as ensuring that they are in full compliance with the labor laws and regulations that govern them.</p>

<h3>Building Friendships At Work (January 27, 2016)</h3>
<p>It is abundantly clear that friendships are important in everyone's lives. People with friends are happier than those who don't have friends. They have greater self-esteem. They are healthier and they are safer. These benefits can be especially critical for people with disabilities in a world that still often isolates them.</p>

<p>Widening the Circle is a partnership between the Arc of MA and the MA Department of Developmental Services. This project has been exploring the opportunities—formal and informal—that support the development of friendships between people with and without disabilities. These opportunities for friendships are everywhere, where people live, learn, play and WORK.</p>

<p>Please join Rick Hawes (Director of Employment Services at the Berkshire County Arc) and Jim Ross (Co-coordinator of Widening the Circle) as they explore WHY supporting friendships in the workplace is important. This webinar will also discuss WHAT employment staff can do to support friendships. Whether you facilitate planning, are a job developer, or are a job coach, there is a role for you!</p>
