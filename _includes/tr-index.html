          It's more important than ever to make sure job seekers are appropriately using their time to prepare and plan for entering or re-entering the workforce. In this online training, participants will learn how to coordinate and implement person-centered career planning strategies. Over the course of two sessions, the training will also cover strategies to assess a job seeker’s employment goals, abilities, and interests. Topics will include how to identify personal and family networks, develop vocational profiles and schedules, create 30-day placement plans, and use Discovery to identify vocational goals. Participants are expected to attend both sessions, and letters of completion will be provided at the end of the training.
