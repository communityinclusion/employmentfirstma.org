        This 2-hour training highlights the main barriers to employment for people who receive Social Security disability benefits. In this training, you will learn about existing work incentives, reporting requirements, your rights as someone who receives Social Security benefits, and employment programs that can help you realize that work is possible. We will share a variety of community resources about where and how to get support to make informed decisions about employment and benefits. </p>

          Is your Family Support Center working with older caregivers? Since
          COVID the notion of Future Planning has been a concern for many
          families- not only for the aging caregiver but for their adult sons
          and daughters. Kerry Mahoney from The Arc of Massachusetts will
          present how the Charting the LifeCourse quick guide to Life
          Experiences Aging Booklet can help facilitate this discussion and take
          action.

          Monthly Tools in Action webinars take place from 12pm-1pm on the
