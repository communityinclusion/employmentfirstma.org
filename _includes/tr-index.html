          It's more important than ever to make sure job seekers are appropriately using their time to prepare and plan for entering or re-entering the workforce. In this online training, participants will learn how to coordinate and implement person-centered career planning strategies. Over the course of two sessions, the training will also cover strategies to assess a job seekerâ€™s employment goals, abilities, and interests. Topics will include how to identify personal and family networks, develop vocational profiles and schedules, create 30-day placement plans, and use Discovery to identify vocational goals. Participants are expected to attend both sessions, and letters of completion will be provided at the end of the training.

          Is your Family Support Center working with older caregivers? Since
          COVID the notion of Future Planning has been a concern for many
          families- not only for the aging caregiver but for their adult sons
          and daughters. Kerry Mahoney from The Arc of Massachusetts will
          present how the Charting the LifeCourse quick guide to Life
          Experiences Aging Booklet can help facilitate this discussion and take
          action.
