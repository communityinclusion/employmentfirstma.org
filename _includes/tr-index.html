          Is your Family Support Center working with older caregivers? Since
          COVID the notion of Future Planning has been a concern for many
          families- not only for the aging caregiver but for their adult sons
          and daughters. Kerry Mahoney from The Arc of Massachusetts will
          present how the Charting the LifeCourse quick guide to Life
          Experiences Aging Booklet can help facilitate this discussion and take
          action.
